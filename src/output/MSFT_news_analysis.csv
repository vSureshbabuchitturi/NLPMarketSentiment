However, Financial Futurist Dave Nadig, says many are ""overdone"" in mega-caps like Nvidia (NVDA) and Meta (META) which drive gains. He warns of ""concentration risks,"" noting that in the Technology Select Spdr Fund (XLK) just 5 names account for more than 50% of the fund. Nadig advises those investing in tech to ""look for strategies that are a little bit more equal-weighted."" He suggests something like the Robo Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF (ROBO) which is ""much more balanced"" with global diversification across use cases. Many tech ETFs have ""hyper-concentrated"" portfolios, with stocks like Microsoft (MSFT), for example, dominating the top holdings. On the days that dominate stock does well, ""performance will beat everybody else,"" while down days see similar exaggerated moves. Nadig recommends focusing on long-term plays that ""benefit over the cycle, not just over the headline."" Beyond tech, Nadig highlights healthcare as an attractive sector, suggesting the Simplify Healthcare ETF (PINK) for exposure without ""veering entirely"" into biotech/pharma - providing ""nice balance.""

He notes the Magnificent Seven valuations have diverged ""drastically,"" causing investors to ""differentiate"" between them rather than treat them as a uniform group.
