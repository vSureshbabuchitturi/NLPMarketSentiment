WestEnd Capital Management senior equity analyst Ali Mogharabi joins hosts Julie Hyman and Jared Blikre on Market Domination to discuss his outlook for the semiconductor company in the coming year. Mogharabi explains that the artificial intelligence trade is shifting from training to inference capabilities, which will mean a stronger focus on determining ""what to do with new data and how to interpret it."" This transition requires more specialized chips, positioning Broadcom to capitalize on the trend. Mogharabi points out that these chips will require increased network infrastructure to be effective, noting that Broadcom is ""one of the main players on the network/connectivity side of it, too."" ""Opportunities for Broadcom itself to generate revenues are going to be growing from around 15 to 20 billion currently to 60 to 90 billion through 2027,"" Mogharabi tells Yahoo Finance.

Vistra (VST) has emerged as the index's top performer, surpassing Nvidia's (NVDA) remarkable run. The company's performance can be attributed to robust earnings and strategic acquisitions, particularly its moves to establish a presence in the nuclear energy sector to meet growing artificial intelligence–related power demands. Nvidia maintains its position as the S&P 500's second-best performer. The semiconductor giant achieved a historic milestone this year by becoming the world's largest publicly traded company by market capitalization, exceeding $3 trillion. However, the company continues to navigate challenges in the Chinese market. GE Vernova (GEV) also demonstrated impressive performance in 2024, posting a 143% gain following its April spinoff from General Electric. The company has further strengthened investor confidence by initiating its first dividend payment and upgrading its multiyear financial outlook.
